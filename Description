Distributed System based on Serverless Computing in the IBM Cloud.
This program uses the IBM Cloud Functions service through the IBM-PyWren middleware 
(http://cloudlab.urv.cat/josep/distributed_systems/p1-Sampe.pdf) and the Rabbit MQ 
service.

A finite number of functions are generated according to the number entered as argument.
Each functions generates a random number that is transmitted to the other functions
using a fanout Exchange. A coordinator ("master") guarantees mutual exclusion among
processes and ensures all functions receive values in the same order. Finally, every
serverless function returns the same list of values.
